Super Mario Bros. is one of the most influential games ever released in the history of video games. It was first published on the Famicom in Japan, and on the Nintendo Entertainment System around the world. It was the number one selling Famicom game released in 1985, selling approximately 6,810,000 copies in its production cycle, over four times as many as the next best selling game, Soccer. It was one of two games that were largely credited with reviving the depressed video game market in the United States, which had plummeted around 1983. The other game credited was The Legend of Zelda, and both games were the creation of world recognized game designer, Shigeru Miyamoto.
